        Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites
        and web applications. It provides a collection of CSS and JavaScript components, as well as a grid
        system, typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other user interface elements.

        The main goal of Bootstrap is to simplify the process of web development by providing pre-designed and
        pre-styled components that can be easily customized and adapted to suit different projects. It allows
        developers to create modern and professional-looking websites without starting from scratch.

        Key features of Bootstrap include:
    <div id="img"><img src="bootstrapinfo.jpg" class="img" alt="..."></div>

    <hr>
        1.Responsive Grid System: Bootstrap offers a flexible grid system based on a 12-column layout, making it
        easy to create responsive designs that adapt to various screen sizes and devices.
        <hr>
        2. CSS Components: Bootstrap includes a wide range of CSS classes and styles for common UI components
        such as buttons, forms, alerts, navigation bars, dropdowns, modals, carousels, and more. These
        components can be easily customized using CSS or by overriding Bootstrap's default styles.
        <hr>
        3.JavaScript Plugins: Bootstrap comes with a set of JavaScript plugins that enhance the functionality of
        the UI components. Examples of these plugins include tooltips, modals, carousels, scrollspy, and
        collapsible navigation menus.
        <hr>
        4.Customization: Bootstrap provides a customization option that allows developers to tailor the
        framework
        to their specific needs. It provides a customization page on its official website where you can select
        which components and features you want to include in your custom build.
        <hr>
        5.Browser Compatibility: Bootstrap is designed to work well across different browsers and devices,
        ensuring a consistent user experience.

        To use Bootstrap, you can either download the precompiled CSS and JavaScript files from the official
        website and include them in your project, or you can use a content delivery network (CDN) to link to the
        hosted Bootstrap files.

        Overall, Bootstrap is a powerful and widely adopted framework that can significantly speed up the
        development process and help create visually appealing and responsive web interfaces.</p>
