            JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily used for developing web
            applications. It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications and has since become one of
            the most widely used languages for web development.

            JavaScript is primarily known as a client-side scripting language, meaning it runs on the user's web browser
            rather than on the web server. It provides functionality to enhance the interactivity and dynamic nature of
            web pages. However, with the introduction of Node.js, JavaScript can now also be used for server-side
            development.

            Here are some key points about JavaScript:

        <hr>
        1.Purpose: JavaScript was initially developed to add interactivity to web pages by manipulating their
        content
        and behavior dynamically. It enables developers to create interactive elements, perform form validations,
        handle
        events, and dynamically update the page without requiring a page reload.
        <hr>
        2.Syntax: JavaScript has a C-like syntax with features borrowed from Java and C. It is a loosely typed
        language,
        which means you don't have to explicitly declare the data types of variables. It also supports
        object-oriented
        programming concepts such as objects, classes, and inheritance.
        <hr>
        3.Features: JavaScript offers a wide range of features, including support for variables, data types
        (numbers,
        strings, booleans, arrays, objects), operators, control structures (conditionals, loops), functions, error
        handling, regular expressions, and more.
        <hr>
        4.DOM Manipulation: JavaScript provides access to the Document Object Model (DOM) of an HTML document. The
        DOM
        represents the structure of the web page as a tree-like structure, and JavaScript allows you to manipulate
        and
        interact with the elements, styles, and content of the page.
        <hr>
        5.Libraries and Frameworks: JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that simplify web
        development. Some popular libraries include jQuery, React, Vue.js, and AngularJS, while popular frameworks
        include React.js, Angular, and Node.js.
        <hr>
        6.Asynchronous Programming: JavaScript supports asynchronous programming using callbacks, promises, and
        async/await syntax. This allows handling time-consuming operations like making HTTP requests or
        reading/writing
        to databases without blocking the execution of other code.
        <hr>
        7.Compatibility: JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and
        Edge.
        However, different browsers may have variations in terms of their JavaScript implementation and supported
        features.
        <hr>
        It's important to note that Java and JavaScript are two different programming languages. Despite the similar
        names, they have different syntax, use cases, and purposes. Java is a statically typed language used for
        various
        applications, including server-side development, desktop applications, mobile apps, and more.

        JavaScript, on the other hand, is primarily used for client-side web development, but with the advent of
        Node.js, it can also be used for server-side programming.
